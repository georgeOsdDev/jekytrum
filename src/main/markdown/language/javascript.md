# Javascript

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

> JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/; JS) is a dynamic computer programming language[5]. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed.[5] It is also used in server-side network programming with frameworks such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.

```javascript
var greeting = function(msg){
  console.log("Hello " + msg);
}
greeting("World");
