# Scala
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

> Scala (/ˈskɑːlə/ skah-lə)[5] is an object-functional[6] programming language for general software applications. Scala has full support for functional programming and a very strong static type system. This allows programs written in Scala to be very concise and thus smaller in size than most general purpose programming languages. Many of Scala's design decisions were inspired by criticism over the shortcomings of Java.[4]

```scala

object HelloWorld extends App {
  println("Hello, World!")
}

 ```
